Tru's Clockwork Plugins
=========

Here are all my plugins for HL2RP . These will only work with CWHL2RP.


Installation
--------------

The folders in here are all in plugin format, all you have to do is upload the plugins you want to your server's cwhl2rp/plugins .

##### Configure Plugins. If a plugin needs configuring, instructions will be in each plugin folder.

Exceptions 
--------------
* clockwork/combinedatapad - This has two parts, a webserver and gameserver part. Instructions included.
* clockwork/webrosters - This has to be uploaded to a website not the game server.
